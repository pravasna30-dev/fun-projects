## How It Works

A small **10W solar panel** charges a **12V battery** through a charge controller. A **timer relay** periodically switches on a **diaphragm air pump** for a few seconds, sending a burst of air through tubing aimed along the ledge above your balcony. The sudden puff startles pigeons and makes the ledge feel unsafe to perch on.

```
Solar Panel → Charge Controller → Battery
                    ↓ (LOAD output)
              Timer Relay → Air Pump → Tubing → Nozzle
```
